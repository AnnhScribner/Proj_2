**About:**

This project compares linear probing and double hashing as collision resolution strategies in a hash table.

The experiment measures the number of comparisons required for unsuccessful searches under different conditions and analyzes the average and standard deviation across multiple trials.

I built this project to practice hash tables, collision resolution, inheritance, and experimental analysis in Python.
